# About Us
With over fifteen years of experience in learning & development, I was sick of seeing clumsy online courses that completely missed the mark, clunky systems and complicated pricing models. Knowing it could be done better, I started building Abbio, the instinctive LMS.
<br><br>
## A bit more about me
I spent about 12 years working with some of New Zealand's largest organisations, across many sectors and industries. As an employee, manager, consultant, contractor, freelancer and then business owner, I've heard it all. Well, I take that back, I haven't heard someone jump for joy over their LMS. I'm keen to find the roadblocks, pain points and create something great.

Oh, I'm not doing this alone. I run a little digital company called [**Waggingtail**](http://waggingtail.co){:target="_blank"}, where we create learning solutions (content and the systems) for customers of all shapes and sizes. The small team that could will! Please join me if what I've said resonates, we could do with the help!
<br><br>

## Oh, and we believe in a few things
#### Being Innovative
It’s the fuel that drives success and powers us.

#### Being Customer Obsessed
It’s how we earn customer loyalty and respect every day.

#### Being Surgical
Our surgical precision is what makes us so agile and accurate.

#### Being Hungry
When we win, our customers win – and we love playing offence.

#### Being Passionate
We love what we do and do what we love. It’s the only way.
